## Hey there, I'm Hunain Adhikari! 👋

Master’s in Applied Computing 🎓 | Ex-Barclays Software Engineer 💻 | Aspiring Tech Innovator 🚀

I’m the kind of person who loves to tinker with code and see where it takes me. Whether it's building blockchain-based fund disbursal systems 🏦 (because who doesn't love tackling government corruption one smart contract at a time?) or creating games in Unity because I never quite outgrew my childhood gaming addiction 🎮, I’m always on the lookout for projects that let me explore new tech.

Some of my *code babies* include:

- **Donate for Corona**: Connecting people during the pandemic to help those in need (because even when the world stops, we don’t).
- **FundEasy**: Single-point secure software for government fund disbursal—because we all know bureaucracy needs a little innovation.
- **Defraud**: Fighting corruption with blockchain, because let’s face it, someone has to do it.
- **Covid Data Visualization**: Tracking cases, casualties, and medical supply needs—turning chaos into clarity, one chart at a time.
- **Runner2D**: My very first game made with Unity and C#. Spoiler alert: You *will* trip, but you’ll have fun doing it.

When I’m not coding, I’m likely buried in AWS learning material for my Cloud Practitioner exam, researching new tech, or planning my next big project. Oh, and did I mention I’m all about improving how we assess subjective answers? My app **ASSESS** does just that with a 90% correlation to human grading. Efficiency + personalization = 🏆.

I’m always up for a challenge, especially when it involves building something new and exciting, so feel free to explore my repositories, or better yet, let’s collaborate on something epic!
